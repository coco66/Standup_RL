Here I share some of my publically available codes (written only for individual researches) for learning stand-up motions for humanoid robots.
The codes can't be run within the folder. You may be able to run them with the "Upennalizers", an open source repository (https://github.com/UPenn-RoboCup/UPennalizers.git).
